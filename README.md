##The Expense Tracker App is a mobile application built using Java in Android Studio with the aim of helping users manage their personal finances effectively. In today’s fast-paced world, tracking daily expenses is essential for maintaining financial discipline. This app offers a simple yet efficient way for users to log their expenditures, monitor spending habits, and maintain a record of their financial transactions directly from their Android devices.

The core functionality of the app revolves around adding, viewing, and managing expenses. Users can input the name of the expense, the amount spent, and the date of the transaction. All expense records are stored locally on the user’s device using SQLite, a lightweight, embedded database supported natively in Android. This ensures that the app functions seamlessly offline without the need for internet connectivity.

The app comprises two main activities: the MainActivity, which displays a list of all recorded expenses along with a running total of the user’s spending, and the AddExpenseActivity, which provides a form to enter new expenses. These activities are designed with XML layouts to offer a clean and intuitive user interface. The user experience is enhanced by keeping navigation simple and interactions minimal, making it accessible even to non-technical users.

In terms of architecture, the app follows a straightforward structure. A model class named Expense represents each expense with properties such as id, title, amount, and date. The ExpenseDbHelper class extends SQLiteOpenHelper and manages the creation and maintenance of the database. It also handles CRUD operations like inserting new records and retrieving existing ones. This separation of concerns ensures the app remains organized and maintainable.

Technologically, the app is built entirely in Java, a popular and well-supported language for Android development. Android Studio serves as the integrated development environment (IDE), providing tools for design, coding, and debugging. UI components like ListView or RecyclerView are used to display expense data dynamically, and user inputs are handled through EditText, Button, and other standard Android widgets.

Although this version of the Expense Tracker is relatively simple, it lays the foundation for more advanced features in the future. Potential enhancements include integrating categories for expenses, setting monthly budgets, generating visual reports with charts, syncing data to the cloud via Firebase, or exporting records as PDF or CSV files. Additionally, implementing the Room Persistence Library along with ViewModel and LiveData would modernize the app’s architecture and improve scalability.

In conclusion, the Expense Tracker App demonstrates how Java and Android Studio can be used to develop a practical and functional mobile application. It addresses a common real-world problem—tracking expenses—in a way that is accessible and user-friendly. The project also serves as a valuable learning experience in Android app development, database integration, and UI/UX design.
